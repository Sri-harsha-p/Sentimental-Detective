    "reviewText": "It is a very cute case. None of the jewels have fallen off and the bow is glued on very well. Came in the time frame that was given and I'm happy with this purchase. The only thing you might want to know is, I carry my phone in my jeans and it does fit very tightly because it is a big bow. You have to be careful but worth it.",
